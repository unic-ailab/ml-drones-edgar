# ml-drones-edgar

This repo contains coding files that include my first attempts at machine learning algorithms, data analysis, finalized machine learning models, and modified flockai files.

ML_Testting: Includes initial efforts at support vector machine and linear regression to compare different variables from the flights.csv dataset.

Graphs.ipynb: Includes several graphs comparing different variables against each other to determine relations

ML_Models.ipynb: Includes the finalized machine learning models using linear regression, and random forest regression to analyze Wind Speed, Velocity Y, and Linear Acceleratiton Y. SVM was used to analyze Velocity Y using several labels.

Flockai: Includes a modified world and controller from the flockai demos that is able to run the previously mentioned models, which are also include here. Furthermore, it includes two data files, velocity_y_data.txt and linear_acceleration_y_data.txt, modified flockai sensor files to get the average velocity and linear acceleration, and instructions on how to use them.
